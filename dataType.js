#Datatype
    JavaScript is a dynamic type language, 
    means you don't need to specify type of the variable because 
    it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. 
    You need to use (var/let/const) here to specify the data type. 
    It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc

#Example
    var a=40;//holding number .
    var b="Rahul";//holding string .
    
    
    let var1 = 42;    // var1 is now a number
    var1    = 'bar'; // var1 is now a string
    var1    = true;  // var1 is now a boolean

# Datatype in JS 

    a.primative Data-type
    
        1.STRING
            -It represent a series of characters and is writen with quotes.
             A string can be represented using a single or a double quote.

             Example:
                var str="my name is prakash";
                var str2="Welcome to my place";

        2.NUMBER
            -It represents a number and can be written with or without decimals.

            example:
             let num1=625;
             let num2=6.77;

        3.BigInt
            -
        4.Boolean
            -It represents a logical entity and can have only two values:true or false.
             booleans are generally used for conditional testing.
            
            Example:
                let status=true;
                let status=false;
                let a=1;
                let b=1;
                console.log(a==b) // o/p-true;


        5.Undefined
            -when a varaible is declared but not assigned. it has the value of undefined
             ans it's type is also undefined.
            
            Example:
            let name; // By default undefined will be assigned.
            console.log(name) o/p-undefined;
            console.log(typeof name) o/p-undefined;
            let address=undefined;
        6.Null
            -It represent a non-existence or a invalid value;

            example var=null;

            console.log(var2) // error not-defined.
            
        7.Symbol
            -
